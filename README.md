Weight Loss Calculator
======================
This tool uses the Harris Benedict Equation to calculate your BMR. Your BMR is then adjusted to assume you work a desk job. You can then fill in your height, age, weight, goal weight, the minimum and maximum you're willing to burn in a work out, and the number of time a week you work out.

Once that's all done, it generates a table for you to get down to your desired weight.

I'm super game to hear about it. We can only become better through our peers, so open a PR, create a discussion, slander me. However you want to go about it, just get your thoughts to me!
